In the subsequent discussion we can conveniently set
$$g=g_{0}, \quad a=a_{0}, \quad x=x_{0}+x_{1}2+x_{2}2^{2}+ \cdots +x_{n}2^{n}$$
$0 \leqslant x_{0}+x_{1}2+x_{2}2^{2}+ \cdots +x_{n}2^{n} \leqslant q-2,$
where $x_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$, for $0 \leqslant i \leqslant n$, and then
rewrite the relation (\ref{eq:1}) in the form

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
g_{0}^{x_{0}+x_{1}2+x_{2}2^{2}+ \cdots +x_{n}2^{n}}=a_{0} \mbox{ ,}
\end{equation}
Rising both parts of the last equation to the power $(q-1)/2$ and
taking into account that the following relation ...
